## Introduction

Menstrual pain (medical term: Dysmenorrhea) is a common problem affecting women of reproductive age worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, approximately 45%-95% of women of reproductive age experience varying degrees of menstrual pain. The pain ranges from mild mood effects to severe disruption of daily work, study, and life. Faced with monthly recurring pain, besides medication, more and more women are seeking natural, complementary relief methods. Among these, essential oil aromatherapy has gained attention for its unique fragrances and potential physiological benefits.

### Physiological Mechanism of Menstrual Pain

The primary physiological mechanism of menstrual pain is related to excessive release of **prostaglandins** from the endometrium during menstruation. Particularly prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), which causes strong uterine smooth muscle contractions and vascular spasms, leading to local uterine ischemia and hypoxia, resulting in spasmodic or dull pain. High levels of prostaglandins may also stimulate gastrointestinal smooth muscle, causing accompanying symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

### Scientific Principles of Essential Oil Aromatherapy

The scientific principles behind essential oil aromatherapy for menstrual pain relief are multifaceted:

- **Nervous System Regulation**: Essential oil fragrances are transmitted through olfactory nerves to the brain's limbic system, affecting emotions and stress perception, potentially promoting the release of endogenous analgesic substances like endorphins.
- **Anti-inflammatory Action**: Some essential oils contain components that can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis or reduce inflammatory responses.
- **Antispasmodic Action**: Certain essential oils can relax uterine smooth muscle, alleviating uterine spasms.
- **Improved Blood Circulation**: Massage combined with essential oils can promote pelvic blood circulation, relieving uterine ischemia.

## Six Core Essential Oils Detailed

### 1. Lavender Essential Oil
