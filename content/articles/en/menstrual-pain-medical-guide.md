# Medical Guide to Menstrual Pain: Complete Analysis of Causes, Diagnosis & Scientific Treatment

## Introduction

Menstrual pain (Dysmenorrhea) affects 70-90% of women of reproductive age globally, with 10-15% experiencing severe pain that significantly impacts daily life and work. As an important component of women's reproductive health, menstrual pain is not merely a physiological phenomenon to "endure and get through," but a medical condition requiring scientific understanding, accurate diagnosis, and effective management.

This guide provides an in-depth medical analysis of the pathophysiological mechanisms of menstrual pain, detailed classification of 10 major causes, professional diagnostic methods, and guidance on when to seek medical help. It aims to help women develop scientific understanding of menstrual pain and achieve precise health management.

## What is Menstrual Pain? Medical Definition of Symptoms

### Core Symptom Characteristics

The core symptom of menstrual pain is cyclical lower abdominal pain occurring during menstruation. From a medical perspective, this pain has the following characteristics:

- **Pain Nature**: Cramping, colicky, or persistent dull pain
- **Pain Location**: Primarily in the lower abdomen, may radiate to lower back and inner thighs
- **Timing**: Closely related to menstrual cycle, usually appearing before or during menstruation
- **Duration**: Ranging from hours to days

### Associated Symptom Spectrum

Menstrual pain is often accompanied by the following systemic symptoms:

**Gastrointestinal Symptoms**:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Diarrhea or constipation
- Loss of appetite

**Neurological Symptoms**:
- Headache and dizziness
- Fatigue and weakness
- Difficulty concentrating

**Endocrine-Related Symptoms**:
- Breast tenderness
- Mood swings and irritability
- Edema

### Pain Severity Classification

Based on the impact of pain on daily life, menstrual pain can be classified as:

- **Mild**: Minor pain, no impact on daily activities
- **Moderate**: Noticeable pain, mild impact on daily activities, may require pain medication
- **Severe**: Intense pain, severely affects daily activities, requires bed rest or sick leave

## Medical Classification and Cause Analysis of Menstrual Pain

### Primary Dysmenorrhea: Pain Caused by Physiological Mechanisms

Primary dysmenorrhea refers to functional menstrual pain without organic pathology, accounting for 80-90% of menstrual pain cases. Main mechanisms include:

#### Cause 1: Excessive Prostaglandin Secretion

**Pathogenesis**:
- Endometrial shedding during menstruation releases large amounts of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α)
- PGF2α causes intense uterine smooth muscle contractions
- Uterine vascular constriction leads to local ischemia
- Prostaglandins enter blood circulation causing systemic symptoms

**Clinical Features**:
- Pain appears synchronously with menstruation
- Mostly cramping pain
- Often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

#### Cause 2: Abnormal Uterine Muscle Contractions

**Pathogenesis**:
- Increased uterine muscle sensitivity to prostaglandins
- Abnormal frequency and intensity of uterine contractions
- Narrow cervical canal in adolescents increases contraction resistance

**Clinical Features**:
- Pain severity not completely correlated with prostaglandin levels
- May be accompanied by abnormal menstrual flow

#### Cause 3: Vasopressin Influence

**Pathogenesis**:
- Elevated vasopressin levels
- Synergistic action with prostaglandins enhances uterine contractions
- Affects uterine blood flow perfusion

**Clinical Features**:
- Pain may begin before menstruation
- Often accompanied by water-sodium retention symptoms

### Secondary Dysmenorrhea: Pain Caused by Organic Diseases

Secondary dysmenorrhea is caused by pelvic organic diseases, accounting for 10-20% of menstrual pain cases, but the proportion increases with age.

#### Cause 4: Endometriosis

**Disease Mechanism**:
- Functional endometrial tissue implanted outside the uterine cavity
- Ectopic endometrium bleeds with menstrual cycles
- Causes local inflammation, adhesions, and cyst formation

**Clinical Features**:
- Progressive worsening menstrual pain
- Deep dyspareunia
- May be associated with infertility
- Pain may persist after menstruation

#### Cause 5: Adenomyosis

**Disease Mechanism**:
- Endometrial glands and stroma invade the uterine muscle layer
- Ectopic endometrium bleeding in muscle layer causes thickening
- Uterine volume increases, abnormal contractions

**Clinical Features**:
- Diffuse lower abdominal pain
- Increased menstrual flow and prolonged periods
- Uniform uterine enlargement

#### Cause 6: Uterine Fibroids

**Disease Mechanism**:
- Benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus
- Affect uterine contraction patterns
- Compress surrounding tissues and blood vessels

**Clinical Features**:
- Pain severity related to fibroid location and size
- Submucosal fibroids have most obvious symptoms
- Often accompanied by increased menstrual flow

#### Cause 7: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

**Disease Mechanism**:
- Upper reproductive tract infection and inflammation
- Chronic inflammation leads to adhesion formation
- Pain worsens during pelvic congestion

**Clinical Features**:
- Persistent pelvic pain
- May be accompanied by fever and abnormal discharge
- Dyspareunia and dysuria

#### Cause 8: Intrauterine Device Related

**Disease Mechanism**:
- Copper ions cause aseptic inflammation
- Increase prostaglandin release
- Foreign body stimulates uterine contractions

**Clinical Features**:
- Worsened menstrual pain after IUD insertion
- Menstrual flow may increase
- Pain related to IUD type

#### Cause 9: Pelvic Adhesions

**Disease Mechanism**:
- Sequelae of surgery, infection, or endometriosis
- Fibrous band formation limits organ mobility
- Menstrual pelvic congestion pulls adhesive bands

**Clinical Features**:
- Relatively fixed pain location
- May be accompanied by intestinal symptoms
- Position changes may affect pain

#### Cause 10: Reproductive Tract Malformations

**Disease Mechanism**:
- Congenital or acquired structural abnormalities
- Affect menstrual blood outflow
- Increase uterine contraction resistance

**Clinical Features**:
- Severe menstrual pain immediately after menarche
- May be accompanied by menstrual abnormalities
- Requires imaging examination for diagnosis

## Differential Diagnosis of Menstrual Pain

### Differentiation from Other Abdominal Pain

Accurate differentiation of menstrual pain from other causes of abdominal pain is crucial for correct diagnosis:

#### Menstrual Pain vs Early Pregnancy Cramping vs Labor Contractions

**Timing Characteristics:**
- **Menstrual Pain**: Related to menstrual cycle, cyclical occurrence
- **Early Pregnancy Cramping**: After missed period, irregular
- **Labor Contractions**: Full-term pregnancy, highly regular

**Pain Nature:**
- **Menstrual Pain**: Cramping or dull pain, mainly lower abdomen
- **Early Pregnancy Cramping**: Mild pulling sensation, similar to mild menstrual pain
- **Labor Contractions**: Intense contraction feeling, entire uterus tightening

**Associated Symptoms:**
- **Menstrual Pain**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and other menstrual-related symptoms
- **Early Pregnancy Cramping**: Early pregnancy symptoms, beware of ectopic pregnancy if bleeding occurs
- **Labor Contractions**: Bloody show, water breaking and other labor signs

**Duration:**
- **Menstrual Pain**: Hours to days, relief after menstruation
- **Early Pregnancy Cramping**: Intermittent and brief episodes
- **Labor Contractions**: Progressively longer with shorter intervals

### Differentiation Between Primary and Secondary Dysmenorrhea

**Age of Onset:**
- **Primary Dysmenorrhea**: 1-2 years after menarche
- **Secondary Dysmenorrhea**: After puberty, especially after age 30 or childbirth

**Pain Pattern:**
- **Primary Dysmenorrhea**: Synchronous with menstruation, appears hours before or after menstruation begins
- **Secondary Dysmenorrhea**: May start 1-2 weeks before menstruation, longer duration

**Pain Nature:**
- **Primary Dysmenorrhea**: Cramping colicky pain, mainly concentrated in lower abdomen
- **Secondary Dysmenorrhea**: Varied pain types, may involve wide pelvic areas

**Pain Trend:**
- **Primary Dysmenorrhea**: May decrease with age or after childbirth
- **Secondary Dysmenorrhea**: Progressively worsens over time

**Associated Symptoms:**
- **Primary Dysmenorrhea**: Mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and other systemic symptoms
- **Secondary Dysmenorrhea**: Besides systemic symptoms, often has heavy menstrual flow, dyspareunia, infertility and other gynecological-specific symptoms

**Physical Examination Findings:**
- **Primary Dysmenorrhea**: Gynecological examination usually normal
- **Secondary Dysmenorrhea**: May find uterine enlargement, tenderness, nodules and other signs of organic pathology

## Pain Assessment and Recording Methods

### Standardized Pain Assessment

#### Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
- 0 points: No pain
- 1-3 points: Mild pain, no impact on daily activities
- 4-6 points: Moderate pain, affects daily activities
- 7-10 points: Severe pain, seriously affects quality of life

#### Functional Impact Assessment
Assess pain's impact on:
- Sleep quality
- Work/study efficiency
- Social activity participation
- Exercise capacity
- Emotional state

### Establishing a Menstrual Pain Diary

Recommend recording the following information:
- Menstrual cycle dates
- Pain onset time and duration
- Pain intensity scores
