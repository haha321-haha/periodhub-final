# Global Perspectives on Menstrual Pain Relief: Integrating Traditional Wisdom with Modern Science

## Introduction

Menstrual pain (medically known as dysmenorrhea) is a common health concern affecting millions of women of reproductive age worldwide. While modern medicine has made significant advances, traditional medical systems continue to offer diverse relief strategies. This article explores traditional menstrual pain relief methods from Indian Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and other cultures, combining them with modern scientific research to provide comprehensive pain management solutions for women.

## Understanding Menstrual Pain: Comprehensive Symptom and Cause Analysis

### What is Menstrual Pain? Symptom Review

The core symptom of menstrual pain is cyclical lower abdominal pain occurring during menstruation. This pain is often described as cramping, colicky, or persistent dull pain, sometimes radiating to the lower back and inner thighs.

Common accompanying symptoms include:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Headache and dizziness
- Fatigue and weakness
- Breast tenderness and mood swings (usually occurring with premenstrual syndrome PMS)

Pain intensity varies among individuals, ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain that affects normal study, work, and social activities, sometimes requiring bed rest. Accurately understanding the causes and types of menstrual pain is crucial for effective management.

### Physiological Causes: Primary Dysmenorrhea (Most Common Cause)

Primary dysmenorrhea refers to menstrual pain without pelvic organ pathological changes, usually appearing shortly after menarche. This type of pain is common in young women, typically occurring a few hours before or within 24 hours after menstruation begins, lasting 2-3 days before relief, and may decrease with age or after childbirth.

#### Cause 1: Excessive Prostaglandin Secretion

This is the most primary and common cause of primary dysmenorrhea. In the late menstrual cycle, as progesterone and estrogen levels decline, the endometrium begins to break down and shed. Shedding endometrial cells release large amounts of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). Excessive PGF2α causes strong and frequent uterine muscle contractions (spasms), causing lower abdominal pain. Additionally, PGF2α causes uterine blood vessel constriction, leading to local uterine ischemia and intensifying pain. Prostaglandins may also enter blood circulation, affecting gastrointestinal smooth muscle and causing accompanying symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

#### Cause 2: Abnormal or Sensitive Uterine Muscle Contractions

Besides prostaglandin levels, uterine muscle sensitivity to prostaglandins or its own contraction patterns may affect pain. Some women's uterine muscles may naturally be more sensitive to contractions, or have abnormal contraction frequency and intensity, potentially causing pain even with normal prostaglandin levels. In adolescents, relatively narrow cervical canals may impede smooth menstrual flow, increasing resistance to uterine contractions and indirectly intensifying pain.

#### Cause 3: Vasopressin Influence

Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone, primarily affects water reabsorption. However, research shows vasopressin can also promote uterine muscle contractions. During menstruation, vasopressin levels may rise, working synergistically with prostaglandins to further increase uterine contraction intensity and frequency, exacerbating menstrual pain.

### Pathological Causes: Secondary Dysmenorrhea (Warning Signals)

Secondary dysmenorrhea is caused by pelvic or systemic diseases. This type typically occurs after puberty, especially in women after childbirth or over 30 years old. It's characterized by pain often appearing 1-2 weeks before menstruation, lasting throughout the entire menstrual period or even after, with pain progressively worsening over time, possibly accompanied by other gynecological symptoms (such as heavy menstrual flow, non-menstrual bleeding, painful intercourse, infertility). Secondary dysmenorrhea requires timely medical diagnosis and treatment of underlying causes.

#### Cause 4: Endometriosis

Endometriosis refers to functional endometrial tissue appearing outside the uterine cavity. These ectopic endometrial tissues also bleed during menstruation, accumulating in the pelvis, causing local inflammatory reactions, forming cysts and adhesions, leading to chronic pelvic pain that intensifies during menstruation. Pain is usually persistent chronic pelvic pain, significantly worsening during menstruation, often accompanied by deep dyspareunia, painful defecation or urination.

#### Cause 5: Adenomyosis

Adenomyosis refers to endometrial tissue invading and growing within the uterine muscle layer. These endometrial tissues within the muscle layer also bleed during menstruation, causing muscle layer bleeding, edema, proliferation, and fibrosis, leading to overall uterine enlargement. Adenomyosis-induced menstrual pain typically presents as diffuse, deep pain, feeling like the entire uterus is in pain, often accompanied by heavy menstrual flow and prolonged periods.

#### Cause 6: Uterine Fibroids

Uterine fibroids are common non-cancerous tumors in the uterine muscle layer. Particularly submucosal fibroids growing within the uterine cavity, or larger intramural fibroids, may affect uterine contractions, compress the endometrium or blood vessels, causing menstrual pain and heavy menstrual flow.

#### Cause 7: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to infection and inflammation of the female upper reproductive tract. If treatment is incomplete or infections recur, it may become chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, leading to adhesions and scar tissue formation around fallopian tubes or ovaries. These chronic inflammations and adhesions cause persistent pelvic pain, worsening during menstruation due to pelvic congestion.

#### Cause 8: Intrauterine Device (IUD) Use

Particularly copper-containing IUDs may cause local aseptic inflammatory reactions in the endometrium, increasing prostaglandin release, leading to increased menstrual flow and worsened menstrual pain. Abnormal IUD positioning or partial displacement may also cause pain.

#### Cause 9: Pelvic Adhesions

Pelvic adhesions are abnormal fibrous bands formed between pelvic tissues and organs, often caused by previous pelvic surgery, pelvic infections, or endometriosis. During menstruation when pelvic congestion occurs, adhesive bands are pulled or compressed, causing pain.

#### Cause 10: Uterine or Cervical Abnormalities

Certain congenital or acquired uterine and cervical structural abnormalities may cause menstrual pain, such as uterine malformations (bicornuate uterus, septate uterus, etc.), cervical stenosis or atresia, intrauterine polyps or submucosal fibroids prolapsing into the cervical canal, all of which may affect menstrual flow or stimulate uterine contractions.

### Differential Diagnosis: Menstrual Pain vs Other Abdominal Discomfort

Women may experience various types of abdominal discomfort or cramping sensations. Accurately distinguishing these different conditions is crucial for health assessment. The following are key differential points between menstrual pain, early pregnancy cramping, and labor contractions:

| Differential Dimension | Dysmenorrhea | Early Pregnancy Cramping | Labor Contractions |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Timing/Cyclical Pattern** | Begins during or around menstruation, occurs with menstrual cycles | Occurs after confirmed pregnancy, usually in early pregnancy, not following specific cyclical patterns | Occurs during full-term labor, highly regular, intervals shorten over time |
| **Pain Nature & Location** | Lower abdominal cramping or dull pain, may radiate to lower back and inner thighs | Mild lower abdominal cramping or pulling sensation, may resemble mild menstrual pain | Lower abdomen and lower back, feels like entire uterus tightening, severe pain |
| **Pain Intensity & Pattern** | Occurs with menstrual cycles, intensity varies by individual and cycle, but usually has its own cyclical pattern | Pain is mild, duration indefinite, irregular. If severe, requires caution | Highly regular, uterus relaxes during intervals; progressively intensifies over time, intervals shorten, duration lengthens |
| **Accompanying Symptoms** | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, etc. No pregnancy signs | Accompanied by pregnancy signs (missed period, morning sickness, etc.). If bleeding or severe pain, beware of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage | Accompanied by cervical dilation, bloody show, membrane rupture, and other labor signs |
| **Duration** | Lasts hours to days, usually relieves or decreases after menstruation begins | Duration indefinite, usually short or intermittent | Each contraction has regular duration, total duration extends with labor progression |
| **Relationship to Menstrual Cycle** | Pain closely related to menstruation, occurs cyclically | Occurs after missed period, unrelated to menstrual cycle | Occurs in late pregnancy, unrelated to menstrual cycle |

**Summary Insights:** Cyclical nature is the core feature distinguishing menstrual pain from the other two conditions. Pain pattern and intensity are key to distinguishing early pregnancy cramping from labor contractions. Accompanying symptoms and occurrence context (pregnancy status, gestational age) provide important clinical clues. When unable to clearly distinguish pain nature, especially with severe pain, abnormal bleeding, or fever, immediate medical attention should be sought.

### How to Differentiate Primary vs Secondary Dysmenorrhea?

Distinguishing types of menstrual pain is crucial for selecting appropriate treatment plans. Besides cause-based differentiation, clinical manifestations and pain assessment also help with identification:

| Feature | Primary Dysmenorrhea | Secondary Dysmenorrhea |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Onset Time** | Usually appears 1-2 years after menarche | Usually appears after puberty, especially after childbirth or over age 30 |
| **Pain Pattern** | Pain usually synchronizes with menstruation, appearing hours before or after menstruation begins, lasting 2-3 days before relief | Pain may appear 1-2 weeks before menstruation, lasting entire menstrual period or longer, even non-menstrual pain |
| **Pain Nature** | Mostly cramping, colicky pain, concentrated in lower abdomen | May be cramping, dull, or distending pain, possibly involving broader pelvic areas, progressively worsening over time |
| **Pain Progression** | May decrease with age or after childbirth | Progressively worsens over time |
| **Accompanying Symptoms** | Often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and other systemic symptoms | Besides above symptoms, often accompanied by heavy menstrual flow, non-menstrual bleeding, painful intercourse, infertility, etc. |
| **Physical Examination Findings** | Usually no organic pathological changes | May have uterine or adnexal enlargement, tenderness, nodules, and other abnormal findings |

**Pain Assessment Methods:**
- **Visual Analog Scale (VAS):** Use 0-10 scoring, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most severe pain imaginable. Recording pain scores helps objective assessment.
- **Impact on Daily Life:** Assess whether pain affects sleep, work, study, social activities, or requires sick leave or bed rest.
- **Pain Diary:** Record menstrual cycles, pain occurrence time, nature, degree, accompanying symptoms, and attempted relief methods and their effects, helping identify patterns and communicate with doctors.

### When to Seek Medical Help?

If your menstrual pain presents the following situations, seek medical evaluation promptly to rule out secondary dysmenorrhea or other conditions requiring treatment:

- Menstrual pain is newly occurring (previously painless, now beginning to hurt)
- Pain nature changes or progressively worsens
- Atypical pain (such as persistent rather than limited to menstrual period, atypical pain location)
- Accompanied by fever, chills, abnormal vaginal discharge, non-menstrual bleeding
- Accompanied by painful intercourse or pain during defecation/urination
- Suspected or known history of pelvic diseases (endometriosis, fibroids, PID, etc.)
- Menstrual pain severely affects daily life, regular painkillers ineffective
- Difficulty distinguishing between menstrual pain and other abdominal emergencies (such as appendicitis, ovarian cyst torsion)

Doctors will diagnose through medical history inquiry, pelvic examination, ultrasound, blood tests, secretion examination, etc. MRI or laparoscopic examination may be necessary when required.

## Indian Ayurveda: Holistic Therapy for Mind-Body Balance

Ayurveda is an ancient traditional medical system from India that emphasizes maintaining health through balancing the body's energies. In Ayurveda, menstrual pain is considered a manifestation of imbalanced Vata (wind energy) in the body.

### Dietary Regulation

Ayurveda recommends consuming warm, nourishing foods to balance Vata energy. **Turmeric milk** is a commonly used home remedy, with curcumin having anti-inflammatory properties that can effectively relieve menstrual pain. Additionally, **cumin seed and aloe vera juice formula** is considered a "panacea" for menstrual pain relief, with cumin seeds having warming kidney, dispersing cold, and pain-relieving effects, while aloe vera juice has heat-clearing, intestinal-moistening, and detoxifying properties. Ayurveda also recommends consuming **warm foods** such as cooked vegetables and mild spices like fennel and coriander seeds to promote digestion and blood circulation.

### Herbal Therapies

Ayurveda uses various herbs to relieve menstrual pain, some of which have potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects:

- **Dashamoola Kwatha (Ten Root Decoction)**: Contains multiple herbs that may help inhibit COX-2 enzyme activity, thereby relieving pain.
- **Ashwagandha (Winter Cherry)**: May help regulate the stress hormone cortisol and provide analgesic effects.
- **Shatavari (Asparagus Root)**: Rich in phytoestrogens, may help relieve uterine spasms.
- **Artemisia annua (Sweet Wormwood)**: Has warming meridian, dispersing cold, and blood-activating effects, effectively relieving uterine contractions and reducing menstrual pain.
- **Angelica**: Rich in iron, not only improves anemia during menstruation but also relieves menstrual pain.
- **Astragalus membranaceus**: Can improve body metabolism and promote blood circulation, thereby relieving menstrual pain symptoms.

### Lifestyle Practices

Ayurveda emphasizes reducing stress through yoga, meditation, and adequate rest to improve menstrual cycles. For example, **Supta Baddha Konasana (Reclined Bound Angle Pose)** and other menstrual-specific poses have been proven to effectively reduce pain scores. Additionally, **hot oil massage (Abhyanga)** using sesame oil and turmeric heated to 40℃ for lower abdominal massage can promote prostaglandin metabolism and relieve menstrual pain. Ayurveda also recommends **regular sleep schedules** and **moderate yoga practice** to help regulate menstrual cycles.

## Traditional Chinese Medicine: Comprehensive Approach to Harmonizing Qi and Blood

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that menstrual pain is caused by poor circulation of qi and blood, cold stagnation, or dampness obstruction.

### Chinese Herbal Medicine

TCM prescribes individualized herbal formulas based on personal conditions to harmonize qi and blood and clear meridians. For example:

- **Wenjing Tang**: Activates TRPV1 channels to relieve spasms, with clinical studies showing pain scores can be reduced by ≥50%.
- **Taohong Siwu Tang**: Classic formula for blood activation and stasis removal.
- **Chaihu Shugan San**: Used for qi stagnation-type menstrual pain.
- **Xuefu Zhuyu Wan**: Activates blood and removes stasis, regulates qi and blood.
- **Yimucao Granules**, **Shiwei Huoxue Pills**, **Guizhi Fuling Capsules** and other Chinese medicines work through qi regulation, blood activation, stasis removal, meridian warming, and cold dispersion to fundamentally regulate body functions and relieve menstrual pain.

### Acupuncture Therapy

Acupuncture stimulates specific points such as Guanyuan and Sanyinjiao to promote endorphin release and relieve pain. Moxibustion at Guanyuan point is also commonly used. Additionally, **ear acupoint pellet pressing** stimulates specific ear points such as uterus, endocrine, and Shenmen to regulate qi and blood and relieve menstrual pain symptoms.

### Food Therapy

TCM food therapy emphasizes the principle that "food and medicine share the same source," for example:

- **Brown sugar ginger tea**: Warms meridians and disperses cold.
- **Angelica egg soup**: Nourishes and activates blood.
- **Mugwort boiled eggs**: Warms meridians and relieves pain.
- **Red date and longan tea**: Nourishes qi and blood.
