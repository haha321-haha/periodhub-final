**Why We Recommend:** 
This is a timeless classic that introduces all aspects of women's bodies, health, sexuality, and reproduction in a comprehensive, honest, and empowering way. This book will teach you to understand your body structure, cycle changes, and what's normal versus what needs attention. It encourages you to ask questions and communicate effectively with healthcare professionals, making it an excellent starting point for building bodily autonomy and health awareness. It will help you understand that knowing your body is the most important step in loving yourself.

### 2. Period Power: A Manifesto for the Menstrual Cycle

**Author:** Maisie Hill

**Why We Recommend:** 
This book doesn't just talk about menstruation; it views the menstrual cycle as women's unique "fifth vital sign." Taking a cyclical approach, it teaches you how to use different phases of your menstrual cycle to better live, work, exercise, and socialize. For teenagers, understanding this cyclical rhythm is especially important, helping you better plan study schedules, understand emotional fluctuations, and transform "cycle troubles" into "cycle power."

### 3. Emotional First Aid: Healing Rejection, Guilt, Failure, and Other Everyday Hurts

**Author:** Guy Winch

**Why We Recommend:** 
Menstruation often comes with emotional fluctuations and anxiety. This book provides many practical, easy-to-implement "emotional first aid" tools to help you deal with loss, rejection, guilt, rumination, and other common negative emotions. The techniques in the book are simple to learn and can be used immediately when you feel irritable, anxious, or emotionally low, helping you restore calm and psychological balance more quickly.

### 4. The Wisdom of Your Body: Finding Healing, Wholeness, and Connection through Embodied Living

**Author:** Hillary McBride

**Why We Recommend:** 
This book explores the deep connection between mind and body, helping you understand how to listen to your body's signals and develop a healthier relationship with your physical self. It's particularly valuable for understanding how emotional and physical experiences during menstruation are interconnected, and how to approach your body with compassion and wisdom.

### 5. It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health

**Author:** Robie Harris

**Why We Recommend:** 
The teenage years are a crucial stage for physical development and self-awareness. This book provides not only scientific knowledge about puberty (including menstrual health) but also emphasizes understanding and protecting your health rights. It will tell you how to effectively communicate your needs and concerns with parents, teachers, and doctors, and how to bravely seek help when facing discomfort or abnormalities. This book can enhance your confidence and autonomy in health matters.

### 6. The Mindful Body: Thinking Our Way to Chronic Health

**Author:** Ellen Langer

Menstrual discomfort can sometimes exacerbate psychological stress and negative emotions. This book provides a series of psychological adjustment strategies and tools designed specifically for young people, such as how to engage in positive self-talk, how to build healthy coping mechanisms, and how to handle social pressure.
